# Why?

I'm too lazy to use a VPN, but I do travel.

So I want to know what netflix content is available when i'm visiting my parents.

Audience : People that travel and are into netfix, but not enough to use a VPN.

# DEV : About

-   KISS and YANGI to the extreme, Kept it really simple as a proof of concept.
-   No frameworks because it's a challenge and makes it easier to steal this idea.
-   Defining the rules for a max-100-lines-project on the go, i feel like 100js + 100-html + 100-data fits the spirit.

# DEV : max-100-lines-project

-   index.js = 99 lines (including comments)
-   index.html = 53 lines (there is room to improve within the 100 limit.
-   data.js = Data is exempt from this rule, anyway it's 109 lines.
-   Cheats = needed a proxy to work around CORS, not included.
