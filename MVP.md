Goal : Compare 2 countries in netflix
Please steal this idea.

Visiting my parents in NL, what should I watch here?

# MVP
* KISS and YANGI to the extreme
    * tech demo/ not production.
* publish on github pages
* display diff between country a/b on best tv show(100) : (https://www.flixwatch.co/lists/100-best-tv-shows-on-netflix-germany/)
* select for country a/b
* select for section
* node install, npm build npm publish

# Planning/execution

# b0 : good enough for me
* setup project, git, github, README
* mocks for 4 countries
* parse method for a country page
* diff method for the 2 mocks

# b1 : Ui demo
* add index.html
* fetch 2 countries from mocks
* display diff
* push to github pages

# b3 : Ui with live data



## b3+



# TODO
